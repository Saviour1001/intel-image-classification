# intel-image-classification
Multiclass classification dataset analysed by convolutional neural network 

Here we are dealing with a dataset of good quality images of thing like buildings and glacier. The goal is to create a deep learning model which will be able to classify these images with a considerate accuracy. We will try to approach the problem by setting up a model which will consist of multiple layers and activation functions. 

As the layers get deeper, each layer learns a specific trait of an image and thus more the layers more the model learns specific traits of the images. At the end we will plot how the accuracies increase over the epochs.
